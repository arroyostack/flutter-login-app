# Flutter Login App

This application is a simple login form, where users can enter their email and password, and submit the form. The main focus of this application is not on the authentication process, but on the form creation and input validation. Also ensure that the user enters a valid email and a password that meets certain criteria.

## Features

- Email input field
- Password input field
- Submit button
- Input validation

## Complexity

While the application might seem straightforward, it introduces us to the complexities of managing state in a Flutter application. We start with the classic stateful widget approach, which is suitable for simple applications but can become challenging as the application grows in size.

To address this, we introduce the block pattern, an alternate way of managing state in a Flutter application. This pattern is highly recommended by the Flutter team and is suitable for larger applications with multiple screens.

## Approach

We build this application twice, using two different approaches:

1. Classic stateful widget approach
2. Block pattern

This gives us a chance to compare and contrast the two methods and understand their strengths and weaknesses.

## Note

This application is built as part of a tutorial by Stephen Grider in cour "Dart and Flutter: Developer Guide." to understand the complexities of state management in Flutter. It does not implement actual user authentication.
